In this weather app you could select the state you will like to know the current weather, or write down the state you wish to search for (it also accepts Cities around the world!).

You could hover over the list of states already displayed on screen and click to select the name of the state to be able to search for the current temperature.

After you select or write the place you want to know the temperature of, press enter or click on the submit button to activate the api to get an ordered list of the current temperature and a short description of what is the weather like. (It also displays the temperature in Fahrenheit)
